Hi! 

I am a Data Scientist and a Master’s in Columbia University, interested in Recommendation Systems, NLP, Financial Services and Climate Science.

I am currently working on:
• Comparing RAG’s with Graph RAG’s in LLM’s as an apprentice Data Scientist with L’Oréal.
• Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling of Migrants v/s Non-Migrants from South America and Western Africa as a Research Assistant at Columbia Climate School.
• A Data Scientist at a Fintech Start-up: Prospero.ai where I am analyzing stock market trends.

If you wish to collaborate, learn or have suitable opportunities for Data Scientists, shoot me an email at: zainab.shakruwala@columbia.edu
